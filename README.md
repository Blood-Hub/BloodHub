BloodHub Project Deliverables and Presentation Details

Project Deadline: Sunday, May 28, 2023
Presentation Date: Friday, June 2, 2023

Summary:
As part of the BloodHub project, we have identified two key tasks that need to be completed: JEST testing and creating presentation slides. These tasks will help us demonstrate our understanding and implementation of the code, as well as highlight the reasons behind our coding choices, especially in relation to data structures and Big O notation.

JEST Testing:
To ensure the reliability and functionality of our code, we will be conducting JEST testing. This testing framework allows us to write automated tests that cover various scenarios and functionalities of our application. By performing rigorous testing, we can identify and fix any issues or bugs in our code, ensuring a robust and error-free application.

Presentation Slides:
In addition to the testing phase, we will be preparing presentation slides to showcase our code implementation and decision-making process. During the presentation, we will explain how we have applied different coding methods and techniques, considering factors such as data structure choices and the time and complexity analysis using Big O notation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of our coding practices and demonstrate our understanding of efficient code design.
